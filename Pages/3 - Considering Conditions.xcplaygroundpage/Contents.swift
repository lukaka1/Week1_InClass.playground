 ## Problem 3 - Considering Conditions
 
 This problem begins by declaring an initializing the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. Following that there are 11 expressions that contain relational operators (i.e., conditional expressions). Given the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, you should attempt to _evaluate the expressions by hand_ and predict what the expression evaluates to.
 1. Write your prediction for what the expression will evaluate to in the comment below the expression
 1. Uncomment the expression to see if you evaluated it correctly
 1. Note in the comment after your prediction if you were correct. If you were not correct, describe what mistake you made.
